Since the dawn of time, mankind has practiced the art of trade. The concept has always remained more or less the same (one entity exchanges a set of goods or services for another), but much has changed.

The way the economy functions today is incredibly different from how it did hundreds of years ago. One aspect of that change involves the technology used by each new generation, but there is a much broader economic evolution. Throughout history, the global economy can be segmented into three distinct generations of commerce.

## World Economy 1.0

In World Economy 1.0, buyers and sellers were physically present for each transaction. This was the primary model of trade for the first few thousand years of recorded history.

If you wanted to buy a chicken or a goat in this generation, you approached the owner of the animal, agreed on a price, and made the trade in person.

Generally, trade was done via barter transactions. If you had something the other person wanted, you could trade that product or service for theirs. If you didn't, you were out of luck.

This system was decentralized, consisting of direct relationships between individuals, but it had limits. Trade was extremely limited by geography—not to mention profoundly inefficient—and transactions could take weeks or months to complete. Any attempt at international trade typically meant a year or more of delay.

Over time, people developed basic forms of currency to make trade easier. Through trading something like precious metals, rocks, or colored shells, each culture developed a medium of exchange. This made trade much easier within culture groups, but across group boundaries trade was still difficult and limited.

## World Economy 2.0

As certain forms of currency became more common, the market became more centralized.

Banks arose to establish their own currency standards. Each typically acted as their own mint, issuing coins with their name attached to it in order to build trust. This provided increased consistency, making international trade possible once again.

The defining characteristic of this generation is the dependence on middlemen. At first. these were private banks, but as governments increased in size they took over issuing currency and formalized geographic barriers.

The cost of trade was fairly high, but people were able to trade with the relative assurance that their currency would be accepted by other people.

With innovations in world travel and communication, everyone became more involved in the global economy. This progress came with centralization, however, which led to many systems that crumbled and fell due to greed, ineptitude, or both.

## World Economy 3.0

The world is currently transitioning to the third generation of global commerce.

Similar to 1.0, the system is once again becoming decentralized. Buyers and sellers trade directly with each other, only now without the same geographic limits of the past.

With the prevalence of the internet, people can now communicate with others almost anywhere in the world. With digital products—such as ebooks or music—geographic boundaries no longer represent barrier to trade.

You can now buy a product from someone you've never met on the other side of the world, and have it in your possession within *seconds*.

Despite this peer-to-peer system of communication, finance is still highly centralized. Each government produces their own currency, and payment providers like PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard handle most of the exchange. It may appear that transactions are peer-to-peer, but—similar to 2.0—the middleman is still involved.

For example, when you buy a digital product online using PayPal, the funds are typically transferred from your bank to your PayPal account, and then from your PayPal account to the seller's PayPal account, and finally to the seller's bank account. Even then, the seller doesn't actually hold the funds—their bank does—and they may not be able to use that money for days, a week, or longer.

This is where Bitcoin comes in, and changes commerce forever. Bitcoin makes direct, peer-to-peer exchange possible through an open-source payment system that no central authority controls.

Bitcoin brings the same speed and ease of transfer to finance that already exists in communication, education, and media. Because Bitcoin is both a currency and a payment system, it eliminates the need for middlemen or other centralized authorities.

That's where we are today. Bitcoin is a new technology that is spreading quickly, but has yet to become the standard medium of exchange. Bitcoin dwarfs the capabilities of previous attempts at global finance, but most people still don't understand it.

World Economy 3.0 is peer-to-peer, decentralized, and here to stay.

Welcome to the future.
